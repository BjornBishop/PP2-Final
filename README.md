# Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors

Rock paper scissors is obviously a game that is all about playing rock paper scissors. It is relatively straight forward although I have added my own flare to it in my own ways.

# Features

Below, I will cover the features that I have implemented.

### Weapon Options 
- the three weapon options were created as clickable buttons rather than going for a Div. In my first attempts to use clickable DIVs, I was not getting the feedback loop that I required (visual confirmation of a click being registered). I tried using CSS in order to give the visual stimuli but when starting the project again (i know, silly to start over from scratch) relinking the CSS didnt seem worth it.

- Some CSS was added in order to change the buttons aquamarine for a strong contrasting colour. According to UI standards, aquamarine can be used to highlight interactable elements. 
- Lastly, the ability to see what the player and the computer player selected each round is displayed next to the name of the player. Perhaps a pattern can be spotted...?

### statistics
- I added a winning percentage tracker. I found after a few minutes of playing the game that I had no concept, it felt like there was nothing I was working towards. Sometimes I would win and somtimes i wouldnt. I decided to add a percentage calculator to give the player stakes in the game and look for the pattern in winning percentages.

### Keeping Score
- Similar to the statistics, I wanted to give a clear way for the player to see how often they had beat the computer and vice versa. After adding the statistics and player score, I found I could easily keep randomly clicking on options to get as high percentage as possible.
